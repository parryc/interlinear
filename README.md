# interlinear

Word-aligned interlinear glosses for the web, with the help of JavaScript and CSS.

##TODO

* Save raw text of selected glosses so that configuration changes can be done on the fly (rather than referencing NodeList)
* Something about kerning ... Check common webfonts and see what needs to be done to make them not look bad -- probably fake small-caps for fonts with bad kerning
* Somethings (e.g. querySelectorAll) may not be totally backwards compatible? 
* Add support for tooltips (such as with bootstrap)
* Add support for tagging languages
