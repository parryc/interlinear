<h1><a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php">The Leipzig Glossing Rules</a></h1>
<h2>Styled with <a href="http://parryc.github.io/interlinear">interlinear.js</a></h2>
The Leipzig Glossing Rules have been developed jointly by the Department of
Linguistics of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
(Bernard Comrie, Martin Haspelmath) and by the Department of Linguistics
of the University of Leipzig (Balthasar Bickel). They consist of ten rules for the
"syntax" and "semantics" of interlinear glosses, and an appendix with a
proposed "lexicon" of abbreviated category labels. The rules cover a large part
of linguists' needs in glossing texts, but most authors will feel the need to add
(or modify) certain conventions (especially category labels). Still, it will be
useful to have a standard set of conventions that linguists can refer to, and the
Leipzig Rules are proposed as such to the community of linguists. The Rules
are intended to reflect common usage, and only very few (mostly optional)
innovations are proposed.
<br/>
We intend to update the Leipzig Glossing Rules occasionally, so feedback is
highly welcome.

<h2>The rules</h2>
<strong>(revised version of February 2008)</strong>
<h3>Preamble</h3>

Interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses give information about the
meanings and grammatical properties of individual words and parts of
words. Linguists by and large conform to certain notational conventions in
glossing, and the main purpose of this document is to make the most widely
used conventions explicit.<br/>
Depending on the author's purposes and the readers' assumed background
knowledge, different degrees of detail will be chosen. The current rules
therefore allow some flexibility in various respects, and sometimes alternative
options are mentioned.<br/>
The main purpose that is assumed here is the presentation of an example in a
research paper or book. When an entire corpus is tagged, somewhat different
considerations may apply (e.g. one may want to add information about larger
units such as words or phrases; the rules here only allow for information
about morphemes).<br/><br/>

It should also be noted that there are often multiple ways of analyzing the
morphological patterns of a language. The glossing conventions do not help
linguists in deciding between them, but merely provide standard ways of
abbreviating possible descriptions. Moreover, glossing is rarely a complete
morphological description, and it should be kept in mind that its purpose is
not to state an analysis, but to give some further possibly relevant information
on the structure of a text or an example, beyond the idiomatic translation.<br/><br/>

A remark on the treatment of glosses in data cited from other sources: Glosses
are part of the analysis, not part of the data. When citing an example from a
published source, the gloss may be changed by the author if they prefer
different terminology, a different style or a different analysis.

<h3>Rule 1: Word-by-word alignment</h3>

Interlinear glosses are left-aligned vertically, word by word, with the example. E.g.

<div class="gloss">
Indonesian (Sneddon 1996:237)<br/>
Mereka di Jakarta sekarang.<br/>
They in Jakarta now<br/>
! 'They are in Jakarta now.'
</div>
<br/>

<h3>Rule 2: Morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence</h3>

Segmentable morphemes are separated by hyphens, both in the example and in the
gloss. There must be exactly the same number of hyphens in the example and in the
gloss. E.g.

<div class="gloss">
Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993:207)<br/>
Gila abur-u-n ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuq’-da-č.<br/>
now they-*OBL*-*GEN* farm forever behind stay-*FUT*-*NEG*<br/>
! 'Now their farm will not stay behind forever.'
</div>
<br/>
Since hyphens and vertical alignment make the text look unusual, authors may
want to add another line at the beginning, containing the unmodified text, or resort
to the option described in Rule 4 (and especially 4C).<br/>
Clitic boundaries are marked by an equals sign, both in the object language and
in the gloss.
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss" data-synthetic="1">
West Greenlandic (Fortescue 1984:127)<br/>
palasi=lu niuirtur=lu<br/>
priest=and shopkeeper=and<br/>
! 'both the priest and the shopkeeper'
</div>
<br/>

Epenthetic segments occurring at a morpheme boundary should be assigned to
either the preceding or the following morpheme. Which morpheme is to be chosen
may be determined by various principles that are not easy to generalize over, so no
rule will be provided for this.

<h3>Rule 2A. (Optional)</h3>
If morphologically bound elements constitute distinct prosodic or phonological
words, a hyphen and a single space may be used together in the object language (but
not in the gloss).
<div class="gloss">
Hakha Lai<br/>
a-nii&nbsp;-láay<br/>
*3SG*-laugh-*FUT*<br/>
! 's/he will laugh'
</div>

<h3>Rule 3: Grammatical category labels</h3>

Grammatical morphemes are generally rendered by abbreviated grammatical
category labels, printed in upper case letters (usually small capitals). A list of
standard abbreviations (which are widely known among linguists) is given at the
end of this document.<br/>
Deviations from these standard abbreviations may of course be necessary in
particular cases, e.g. if a category is highly frequent in a language, so that a shorter
abbreviation is more convenient, e.g. CPL (instead of COMPL) for "completive", PF
(instead of PRF) for "perfect", etc. If a category is very rare, it may be simplest not to
abbreviate its label at all.<br/>
In many cases, either a category label or a word from the metalanguage is
acceptable. Thus, both of the two glosses of (5) may be chosen, depending on the
purpose of the gloss.<br/>
<br/>
<em>interlinear.js</em> note: Since lines 3 and 4 are either or but not both, there is currently no support for displaying both at once with the same class.
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss">
Russian<br/>
My s Marko poexa-l-i avtobus-om v Peredelkino. <br/>
*1PL* *COM* Marko go-*PST*-*PL* bus-*INS* *ALL* Peredelkino<br/>
we with Marko go-*PST-PL* bus-by to Peredelkino<br/>
! 'Marko and I went to Perdelkino by bus.'
</div>

<h3>Rule 4: One-to-many correspondences</h3>

When a single object-language element is rendered by several metalanguage
elements (words or abbreviations), these are separated by periods. E.g.
<div class="gloss">
Turkish<br/>
çık-mak<br/>
come.out-*INF*<br/>
! 'to come out'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Latin<br/>
insul-arum<br/>
island-*GEN.PL*<br/>
! 'of the islands'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
French<br/>
aux chevaux<br/>
to.*ART.PL* horse.*PL*<br/>
! 'to the horses'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
German<br/>
unser-n Väter-n<br/>
our-*DAT.PL* father.*PL-DAT.PL*<br/>
! 'to our fathers'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Hittite (Lehmann 1982:211)<br/>
n=an apedani mehuni essandu.<br/>
*CONN*=him that.*DAT.SG* time.*DAT.SG* eat.they.shall<br/>
! 'They shall celebrate him on that date. (CONN = connective)'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Jaminjung (Schultze-Berndt 2000:92)<br/>
nanggayan guny-bi-yarluga?<br/>
who *2DU.A.3SG.P-FUT*-poke<br/>
! 'Who do you two want to spear?'
</div>
<br/>
The ordering of the two metalanguage elements may be determined by various
principles that are not easy to generalize over, so no rule will be provided for this.
There are various reasons for a one-to-many correspondence between objectlanguage
elements and gloss elements. These are conflated by the uniform use of
the period. If one wants to distinguish between them, one may follow Rules 4A-E.

<h3>Rule 4A. (Optional)</h3>
If an object-language element is neither formally nor semantically segmentable and
only the metalanguage happens to lack a single-word equivalent, the underscore
may be used instead of the period.

<div class="gloss">
Turkish (cf. 6)<br/>
çık-mak<br/>
come_out-*INF*<br/>
! 'to come out'
</div>

<h3>Rule 4B. (Optional)</h3>
If an object-language element is formally unsegmentable but has two or more
clearly distinguishable meanings or grammatical properties, the semi-colon may be
used. E.g.

<div class="gloss">
Latin (cf. 7)<br/>
insul-arum<br/>
island-*GEN;PL*<br/>
! 'of the islands'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
French<br/>
aux chevaux<br/>
to;*ART*;*PL* horse;*PL*<br/>
! 'to the horses'
</div>

<h3>Rule 4C. (Optional)</h3>
If an object-language element is formally and semantically segmentable, but the
author does not want to show the formal segmentation (because it is irrelevant
and/or to keep the text intact), the colon may be used. E.g.

<div class="gloss">
Hittite (Lehmann 1982:211) (cf. 10)<br/>
n=an apedani mehuni essandu.<br/>
*CONN*=him that:*DAT*;*SG* time:*DAT*;*SG* eat:they:shall<br/>
! 'They shall celebrate him on that date.'
</div>

<h3>Rule 4D. (Optional)</h3>
If a grammatical property in the object-language is signaled by a
morphophonological change (ablaut, mutation, tone alternation, etc.), the backslash
is used to separate the category label and the rest of the gloss.
<div class="gloss">
German (cf. 9)<br/>
unser-n Väter-n<br/>
our-*DAT.PL* father\*PL-DAT.PL*<br/>
! 'to our fathers (cf. singular Vater)'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Irish<br/>
bhris-is<br/>
*PST*\break-*2SG*<br/>
! 'you broke (cf. nonpast bris-)'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Kinyarwanda<br/>
mú-kòrà<br/>
SBJV\1PL-work<br/>
! 'that we work (cf. indicative mù-kòrà)'
</div>

<h3>Rule 4E. (Optional)</h3>
If a language has person-number affixes that express the agent-like and the patientlike
argument of a transitive verb simultaneously, the symbol ">" may be used in
the gloss to indicate that the first is the agent-like argument and the second is the
patient-like argument.
<div class="gloss">
Jaminjung (Schultze-Berndt 2000:92) (cf. 11)<br/>
nanggayan guny-bi-yarluga?<br/>
who *2DU>3SG-FUT*-poke<br/>
! 'Who do you two want to spear?'
</div>

<h3>Rule 5: Person and number labels</h3>

Person and number are not separated by a period when they cooccur in this order.
E.g.
<div class="gloss">
Italian<br/>
and-iamo xx<br/>
go-*PRS.1PL*<br/>
! 'we go' <br/>
! '(not: go-*PRS.1.PL*)'
</div>
<h3>Rule 5A. (Optional)</h3>
Number and gender markers are very frequent in some languages, especially when
combined with person. Several authors therefore use non-capitalized shortened
abbreviations without a period. If this option is adopted, then the second gloss is
used in (21).
<div class="gloss">
Belhare<br/>
ne-e a-khim-chi n-yuNNa<br/>
*DEM-LOC* *1SG.POSS*-house-*PL* *3NSG*-be.*NPST*<br/>
*DEM-LOC* 1s*POSS*-house-PL 3ns-be.*NPST*<br/>
! 'Here are my houses.'
</div>

<h3>Rule 6: Non-overt elements</h3>

If the morpheme-by-morpheme gloss contains an element that does not correspond
to an overt element in the example, it can be enclosed in square brackets. An
obvious alternative is to include an overt "Ø" in the object-language text, which is
separated by a hyphen like an overt element.
<div class="gloss">
Latin<br/>
puer or: puer-Ø<br/>
boy[*NOM.SG*] xx boy-*NOM.SG*<br/>
'boy' xx 'boy’
</div>

<h3>Rule 7: Inherent categories</h3>

Inherent, non-overt categories such as gender may be indicated in the gloss, but a
special boundary symbol, the round parenthesis, is used. E.g.
<div class="gloss">
Hunzib (van den Berg 1995:46)<br/>
oz#-di-g xõxe m-uq'e-r<br/>
boy-*OBL-AD* tree(G4) *G4*-bend-*PRET*<br/>
! 'Because of the boy the tree bent.' <br/>
! '(*G4* = 4th gender, *AD* = adessive, *PRET* = preterite)'
</div>

<h3>Rule 8: Bipartite elements</h3>

Grammatical or lexical elements that consist of two parts which are treated as
distinct morphological entities (e.g. bipartite stems such as Lakhota na-xʔu̧ 'hear')
may be treated in two different ways:
(i) The gloss may simply be repeated:
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss">
Lakhota<br/>
na-wíčha-wa-xʔu̧<br/>
hear-*3PL.UND-1SG.ACT*-hear<br/>
! 'I hear them (*UND* = undergoer, *ACT* = actor)' helllo hi
</div>
<br/>
(ii) One of the two parts may be represented by a special label such as STEM:
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss">
Lakhota<br/>
na-wíčha-wa-xʔu̧<br/>
hear-*3PL.UND-1SG.ACT*- *STEM*<br/>
! 'I hear them'
</div>
<br/>
Circumfixes are "bipartite affixes" and can be treated in the same way, e.g.
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss">
German<br/>
ge-seh-en or: ge-seh-en<br/>
*PTCP*-see-*PTCP* xx *PTCP*-see-*CIRC*<br/>
'seen' xx 'seen'
</div>

<h3>Rule 9: Infixes</h3>

Infixes are enclosed by angle brackets, and so is the object-language counterpart in
the gloss.
<br/><br/>
<div class="gloss">
Tagalog<br/>
b&lt;um&gt;ili (stem: bili)<br/>
&lt;*ACTFOC*&gt;buy<br/>
! 'buy'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Latin<br/>
reli&lt;n&gt;qu-ere (stem: reliqu-)<br/>
leave&lt;*PRS*&gt;-*INF*<br/>
'to leave'
</div>
<br/>

Infixes are generally easily identifiable as left-peripheral (as in 27) or as right-peripheral
(as in 28), and this determines the position of the gloss corresponding to
the infix with respect to the gloss of the stem. If the infix is not clearly peripheral,
some other basis for linearizing the gloss has to be found.

<h3>Rule 10: Reduplication</h3>

Reduplication is treated similarly to affixation, but with a tilde (instead of an
ordinary hyphen) connecting the copied element to the stem.
<div class="gloss">
Hebrew<br/>
yerak~rak-im<br/>
green~*ATT-M.PL*<br/>
! 'greenish ones (*ATT* = attenuative)'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Tagalog<br/>
bi~bili<br/>
IPFV~buy<br/>
! 'is buying'
</div>
<br/>
<div class="gloss">
Tagalog<br/>
b&lt;um&gt;i~bili<br/>
&lt;*ACTFOC*&gt;*IPFV*~buy<br/>
! 'is buying (*ACTFOC* = Actor focus)'
</div>
